One of the missions of MakeDox is exactly this- merging worlds through the documentary film expression. During its ten-year-long history, MakeDox has presented a wide array of cultural diversity that stretches down the endless film meridians. We are proud to say that in our 10th, jubilee edition we've established international collaboration with the most renowned festivals of documentary films from France, Germany. Iceland and Georgia. In addition, this year we've exchanged a number of experiences regarding the organization, programs, and ideas with the festival FIPADOC from France. This thirty-one-year-old festival has recently decided to focus its entire film program on documentary cinema, together with the most prominent international festival for documentary and animated films in Germany- DOK Leipzig. This year, MakeDox has joined its forces with these two festivals and created the Kids and Youth Program. Further on, the team of MakeDox visited Georgia and Iceland, taking part in the juries of the IceDocs International Documentary Film Festival and CinÃ©DOC-Tbilisi, the leading festival of documentary film in the Caucasian region. At these festivals, together with the film professionals, the audience, the students and the festival organizers, we have exchanged ideas and experiences, collecting inspiration for greater and even more significant future collaborations in the realm of cinema, focusing on the methods of presentation of documentary films to audiences. Finally, we are looking forward to using these collaborations for promoting festivals in the framework of our festival program, believing that this would improve the quality of the program itself and, moreover, it would provide a unique opportunity to the Macedonian audience to keep on enjoying the cohesive power of art in documentary films. Namely, each year, after the end of the festival edition, we feel richer thanks to the new creative stories and experiences that tear down the walls erected around and inside us, so we ardently cross the physical as well as mental borders we encounter. We hope that this year will promote new sparks of inspiration and energy through exchange and collaboration between festivals, in order to keep our creative expression unravel further and to open new doors to different cultural worlds and possibilities for our audience."/>
