Then, the film canvas turns black, so our menu offers a hot spot that links directly to emotions- we dwell upon them, feed their inside, share them or let them go wild… It's time for our version of Scheherazade and 1001 Nights, our bedtime stories. While the guitar, the oud, the kemane and the accordion echo around, one should just carefully listen, and they will hear all the stories that were once told in the dark nooks of this place- all the adventures, misfortunes, boastful lyrics of personal praises and hard fates. And all those who played here prompted by joy, delight, grief or for the sake of shelter or bread. This year, Mr. John Parish will have the honor to awake the hidden stories and melodies in the An. Let's be clear- our expectations are seriously high! See you at night, in the stories…"/>
