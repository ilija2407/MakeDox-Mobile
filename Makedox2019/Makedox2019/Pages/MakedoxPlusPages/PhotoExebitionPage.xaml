            <Label Margin="0,20,0,0" Text="Our app puts characters in a time-machine and although it works at a slower pace and does not require access to your personal data, it often reveals depths of personal intimacy. At the 10th Traveling Cinema of MakeDox, carrying on the tradition of the first cinema-screeners, we created photographs by using ancient technology. We put the faces of our contemporaries in an older frame, mainly presenting our warmhearted hosts and the curious guests in one shot. The resulting magic might not be at anyone’s hand and it certainly doesn’t depend on technology but solely on the human qualities that are embedded in each of these photos. The tiny particles and the bad exposition on the glass plates display additional information for the most extraordinary conditions in the making of these photographs, while also exhibiting the indescribable patience and radiant energy of all those who were photographed. Therefore, these photos are invaluable. A great deal of their beauty has seized due to the digital scanning, however,you will have the opportunity to see them in their original form at the 10th edition of MakeDox. "/>

            <Label Margin="0,20,0,0" Text="When the documentary filmmakers Biljana Garvanlieva and Manuel Zimmer found out that Biljana was diagnosed with lethal cancer, she decides not to be overwhelmed by her fear of her approaching death. Instead, she faced those fears and reflected together with her husband Manuel what this would mean for their lives and the lives of their children. These reflections are engraved as augmented reality content upon a series of 12 portraits of Biljana and Manuel. They are a testament to their love in the time of death."/>

These portraits were based on a series of photos that were taken by the artist Jovan Balov, when Biljana and Manuel moved to Berlin as a young couple. As their ordeal continued Biljana and Manuel documented moments of their life in the form of sound, video, texts or photos. Biljana passed away, but her artistic spirit to face even the most fragile and sensitive time we as humans eventually all must live through, lead to this exhibition."/>    

            <Label Margin="0,20,0,0" Text="The last series of portraits of Biljana and Manuel forms the base to show the second layer of augmented reality. This is a glimpse into their subjective and personal views. This view spawns an arch starting from the moment when the fell in love, through the ordeal of the illness, to the time of passing away. Two layers of time: intimate hours of being together, and spending a lifetime with each other. Their personal experience that is reflected in the images and AR content, is embraced by the universal themes of love, life, and death that they experienced together. What happened outside of the frame of the photos, leads you inside their lives. It’s those moments that count. Not death, but life and time spent together. Each moment lived through is special. Each moment spent together is eternal."/>
