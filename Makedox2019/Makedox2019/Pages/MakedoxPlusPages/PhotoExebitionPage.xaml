At the 10th Traveling Cinema of MakeDox, carrying on the tradition of the first cinema-screeners, we created photographs by using ancient technology.&#x0a;&#x0a; We put the faces of our contemporaries in an older frame, mainly presenting our warmhearted hosts and the curious guests in one shot. The resulting magic might not be at anyone's hand and it certainly doesn't depend on technology but solely on the human qualities that are embedded in each of these photos. &#x0a;&#x0a;The tiny particles and the bad exposition on the glass plates display additional information for the most extraordinary conditions in the making of these photographs, while also exhibiting the indescribable patience and radiant energy of all those who were photographed. Therefore, these photos are invaluable. A great deal of their beauty has seized due to the digital scanning, however,you will have the opportunity to see them in their original form at the 10th edition of MakeDox. "/>

Two layers of time: intimate hours of being together, and spending a lifetime with each other. Their personal experience that is reflected in the images and AR content, is embraced by the universal themes of love, life, and death that they experienced together. What happened outside of the frame of the photos, leads you inside their lives. It’s those moments that count. Not death, but life and time spent together. Each moment lived through is special.
